# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The initial implementation (v0.1.0) of the Deep Research Agent demo is complete, following the plan outlined in `systemPatterns.md` and `projectbrief.md`. All core modules (`agent/`), the CLI (`main.py`), basic tests (`tests/`), configuration (`.env.example`, `requirements.txt`), and documentation (`README.md`) are in place.

The current focus shifts towards:
- **Verification:** Testing the agent with actual API keys and potentially a sample RAG corpus.
- **Refinement:** Addressing any bugs or inconsistencies found during testing.
- **Planning Next Phase:** Considering potential extensions or improvements based on the "Future Ideas" in `README.md` or user feedback.

## Recent Changes (since last Memory Bank update)

- **Completed Chunk 0: Repo Bootstrap:** Initialized Git, created directories, `.env.example`, empty `requirements.txt`. Commit: `05f39a1`.
- **Completed Chunk 1: Core Runtime Skeleton:** Created `agent/` modules stubs, `main.py` CLI, added initial dependencies. Commit: `93c00c3`.
- **Completed Chunk 2: Serper Search Integration:** Implemented `agent/search.py` with API call and error handling. Commit: `091ab76`.
- **Completed Chunk 3: RAG Skeleton:** Implemented `agent/rag.py` stub with ChromaDB setup and checks. Commit: `3bbd49a`.
- **Completed Chunk 4: Reasoning + Synthesis:** Implemented `agent/reasoner.py` and `agent/synthesizer.py` (with OpenAI call + fallback). Commit: `0aa5098`.
- **Completed Chunk 5: Planner & Clarifier:** Implemented simple rule-based planner and identity clarifier. Commit: `4320a4e`.
- **Completed Chunk 6: CLI Wiring & Verbose Flag:** Connected modules in `agent/__init__.py`, added error handling. Commit: `474b94f`.
- **Completed Chunk 7: Local Tests:** Created `tests/mock_serper.json` and `tests/test_agent.py` with offline mocking. Commit: `1a21dc1`.
- **Completed Chunk 8: README & Docs:** Populated `README.md` with all specified sections. Commit: `0600cfd`.
- **Completed Chunk 9: Polish Pass:** Pinned available dependencies in `requirements.txt`, integrated `rich` for verbose logging, tagged `v0.1.0`. Commit: `e998895`.
- Updated `memory-bank/progress.md` to mark all chunks complete.
- Updated `memory-bank/techContext.md` regarding dependency pinning.
- Updated this file (`activeContext.md`).

## Next Steps

1.  **Manual Testing:**
    *   Install dependencies (`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`).
    *   Configure `.env` with valid `SERPER_API_KEY` and optionally `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
    *   Run the agent with various questions (`python3 main.py "..."`).
    *   Test verbose mode (`python3 main.py --verbose "..."`).
    *   Optionally, configure `RAG_DOC_PATH` with sample documents and test RAG functionality.
2.  **Run Automated Tests:**
    *   Execute `python3 -m pytest` to ensure offline tests pass.
3.  **Address Issues:** Fix any bugs or unexpected behavior identified during testing.
4.  **Consider Enhancements:** Review "Future Ideas" in `README.md` or discuss next development goals.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- The core implementation adheres to the v1.1 plan.
- RAG implementation is basic and needs further development for robust document handling and embedding.
- Dependency pinning for `rich`, `pytest`, `chromadb` might need manual verification depending on the environment.
- The project is ready for initial functional testing.
