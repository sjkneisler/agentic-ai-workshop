# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The initial implementation (v0.1.0) was completed, but initial testing revealed SSL certificate errors on macOS and issues with output formatting and answer depth. These have been addressed. Additionally, enhancements for configuration and output verbosity control have been implemented based on user feedback.

The current focus is on:
- **Verification:** Testing the recent fixes (SSL, output) and enhancements (config, verbosity).
- **Refinement:** Ensuring the configuration system works as expected and the verbosity levels provide the correct output.
- **Planning Next Phase:** Considering further enhancements or moving towards goals outlined in `README.md`.

## Recent Changes (since last Memory Bank update - Post v0.1.0)

- **Fixed SSL Errors:** Addressed `SSLError(SSLCertVerificationError)` on macOS by:
    - Adding `certifi` import and `verify=certifi.where()` to `requests.post` in `agent/search.py`.
    - Setting `SSL_CERT_FILE` and `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` environment variables in `main.py` using `certifi.where()`.
- **Corrected Output Formatting:** Fixed `main.py` to correctly print `rich.Panel` objects even when not in verbose mode.
- **Enhanced Answer Depth:** Modified the system prompt in `agent/synthesizer.py` to request more "detailed and comprehensive" answers instead of "concise" ones.
- **Implemented Configuration System:**
    - Created `config.yaml` for agent behavior settings (models, prompts, search count, etc.).
    - Added `PyYAML` to `requirements.txt`.
    - Created `agent/config.py` to load YAML configuration with defaults.
    - Refactored `agent/synthesizer.py` and `agent/search.py` to use settings from `config.yaml`.
    - Added `config.yaml` to `.gitignore`.
- **Implemented Verbosity Levels:**
    - Added mutually exclusive `--quiet` (`-q`, level 0) and `--verbose` (`-v`, level 2) flags in `main.py`, with default level 1.
    - Modified `agent/__init__.py` (`run_agent`) to accept `verbosity_level` and adjust internal printing.
    - `run_agent` now returns `(final_answer, source_urls)`.
    - `main.py` now conditionally prints Processing panel, Source URLs panel, and Final Answer panel based on verbosity level.
- **Updated Documentation:** Modified `README.md` to explain the new `config.yaml` system and verbosity levels.
- **Updated Memory Bank:** This update reflects the changes above. (Self-reference for tracking).

## Next Steps

1.  **Install/Update Dependencies:**
    *   Run `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` (to ensure `PyYAML` is installed).
2.  **Configure Environment & Config:**
    *   Ensure `.env` has valid `SERPER_API_KEY` and optionally `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
    *   Review/modify `config.yaml` to test different settings (e.g., change synthesizer prompt or model).
3.  **Manual Testing (Functionality & Verbosity):**
    *   Run with default verbosity: `python3 main.py "..."` (Check for Processing panel, Sources panel, Final Answer panel).
    *   Run with quiet flag: `python3 main.py -q "..."` (Check for *only* Final Answer panel).
    *   Run with verbose flag: `python3 main.py -v "..."` (Check for Processing panel, intermediate agent steps, Sources panel, Final Answer panel).
    *   Test with different questions and configurations in `config.yaml`.
    *   Optionally, test RAG functionality if configured.
4.  **Run Automated Tests:**
    *   Execute `python3 -m pytest` (Note: Tests may need updates to reflect config changes or new return types if they interact deeply with `run_agent`).
5.  **Address Issues:** Fix any bugs or unexpected behavior identified.
6.  **Consider Enhancements:** Review "Future Ideas" in `README.md` or discuss next development goals.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Configuration:** `config.yaml` is now the primary method for tuning common agent parameters (models, prompts, search count). `.env` remains for secrets.
- **Verbosity:** Three distinct levels (`quiet`, `default`, `verbose`) control the CLI output. Default shows sources, verbose shows internal steps.
- **Agent Output:** `run_agent` now returns both the answer and the list of source URLs.
- **SSL Fix:** The implemented SSL fix targets common macOS issues by explicitly using `certifi` bundle.
- **Testing:** Automated tests (`pytest`) might need updates to accommodate the new configuration system and `run_agent` return type.
- **RAG:** RAG implementation remains basic.
