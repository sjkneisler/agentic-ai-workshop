# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The project is currently in the initialization phase. The Memory Bank structure has just been created based on the initial planning documents (`docs/initial-plan.md`, `docs/implementation-plan.md`, `docs/todo.md`).

## Recent Changes

- Created the `memory-bank/` directory.
- Populated core Memory Bank files:
    - `projectbrief.md` (from initial plan)
    - `productContext.md` (initial placeholder)
    - `systemPatterns.md` (from implementation plan)
    - `techContext.md` (initial placeholder)
    - `activeContext.md` (this file)
    - `progress.md` (from todo list)

## Next Steps

- Begin **Chunk 0: Repo Bootstrap** as defined in `systemPatterns.md` and `progress.md`.
    - Initialize the Git repository (if not already done).
    - Create the base directory structure (`agent/`, `tests/`).
    - Create the initial `.env.example` file.
    - Create an empty `requirements.txt`.
    - Make the initial commit: "Bootstrap repo structure."

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- Following the two-tier implementation plan outlined in `systemPatterns.md`.
- Using the `progress.md` checklist to track task completion.
- Ensuring all core Memory Bank files are established before starting code implementation.
